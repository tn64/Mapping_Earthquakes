# Overview
This analysis of earthquakes from around the world uses the Disaster Reporting Network information provided by the USGS. Here I use the results to provide a website with interactive features and maps for those earthquakes. 

# Resources & Tools
1. Data Sources
- Earthquake Information: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/data.php#eq
- Tectonic Plate Information: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates

2. We used the following software to create the visualizations:
- JavaScript
- Leaflet
- Mapbox
- D3

# Results

The resulting interactive maps are:
